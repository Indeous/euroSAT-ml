## Machine Learning with Hyperparameter Optimization in DASK

The two attached notebooks have explore supervised machine learning algorithms with Hyper-parameter optimization. The dataset used is [EuroSAT](https://zenodo.org/records/7711810#.ZAm3k-zMKEA) imagery. The first notebook uses Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn without DASK. The second, uses MLP classifier with DASK.
